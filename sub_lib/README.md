# sub_lib
Common code for Substratum Rust projects

## Purpose
The purpose of `sub_lib` is to hold all the shared components we use in the projects that make up SubstratumNode.

It is built as a library, and is not intended as a standalone program.
It probably isn't the most interesting place to begin digging into our code;
[node](https://github.com/SubstratumNetwork/SubstratumNode/tree/master/node)
is a better place to start.
