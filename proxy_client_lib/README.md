# proxy_client_lib

## Purpose
The purpose of `proxy_client_lib` is to convert CORES packages from the SubstratumNetwork into regular (non-clandestine) requests,
and convert the regular (non-clandestine) responses back into CORES packages for the SubstratumNetwork.

When you use the SubstratumNetwork, the ProxyClient on some distant SubstratumNode is the component that does the
non-clandestine communication with the greater Internet.
ProxyClient converts your CORES package back into a regular request, gets the response, and wraps it in a new
CORES package. That CORES package goes back onto the SubstratumNetwork to continue on the Route back to you.

It is built as a library, and is not intended as a standalone program.
It probably isn't the most interesting place to begin digging into our code;
[node](https://github.com/SubstratumNetwork/SubstratumNode/tree/master/node)
is a better place to start.
