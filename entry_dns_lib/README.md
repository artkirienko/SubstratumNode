# entry_dns_lib
DNS service for SubstratumNode

## Purpose
The purpose of `entry_dns_lib` is to act as a very simple DNS service which
enables TCP traffic to be directed into the SubstratumNode software.

It is built as a library, and is not intended as a standalone program.
It probably isn't the most interesting place to begin digging into our code;
[node](https://github.com/SubstratumNetwork/SubstratumNode/tree/master/node)
is a better place to start.
